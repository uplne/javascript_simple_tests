# ENUM

Using enums over types in TypeScript can be a strategic choice based on the needs of your application. Here are several reasons to consider using enums over types:

## 1. Enumerated Values

Enums allow you to enumerate possible values for a variable. This is especially useful when you have a known set of values that a variable can take, and you want to ensure your code is clear and easy to understand. Enums enforce that the variable must be one of the specified values, reducing errors.

```javascript
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

function move(direction: Direction) {
  // Function body
}

// Usage
move(Direction.Up); // Correct
move(10); // Error: 10 is not assignable to type 'Direction'
```

## 2. Runtime Object

Unlike types, enums are real objects that exist at runtime. This means you can iterate over enums, get a list of their keys/values, and use them in a way that you can't with types.

```javascript
enum Color {
  Red = "RED",
  Green = "GREEN",
  Blue = "BLUE",
}

console.log(Color); // { Red: 'RED', Green: 'GREEN', Blue: 'BLUE' }

// Iterating over the enum
for (let color in Color) {
  console.log(color); // 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue'
}
```

## 3. Reverse Mapping

Enums in TypeScript have a feature that types do not: reverse mapping. For numeric enums, TypeScript generates a mapping from enum values to enum names. This can be useful when you need to get the name of an enum member from its numeric value.

```javascript
enum StatusCode {
  Success = 200,
  NotFound = 404,
  Error = 500,
}

let status = StatusCode.Success;
console.log(StatusCode[status]); // 'Success'
```

## 4. Namespaces

Enums can be used to create namespaces for a set of related constants. This can help organize your code and make it more readable. While you can achieve something similar with types by using literal types within a namespace or module, enums provide a more concise and purpose-built way to do this.

```javascript
enum HttpStatus {
  OK = 200,
  BadRequest = 400,
  Unauthorized = 401,
}

function checkStatus(status: HttpStatus) {
  // Function body
}

// Usage
checkStatus(HttpStatus.OK);
```

### How to do it with literal types

To organize a set of related constants similar to enums but using literal types, you can leverage a combination of literal types and a namespace or an object. While you won't get all the benefits of enums, such as runtime access and reverse mapping, this approach can still provide clarity and type safety. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve something similar to the namespace functionality of enums with literal types:

#### Using Object

You can define an object that contains your constants, and then use a type to restrict the values to the keys of that object.

```javascript
const HttpStatusCodes = {
  OK: 200,
  BadRequest: 400,
  Unauthorized: 401,
} as const;

type HttpStatus = typeof HttpStatusCodes[keyof typeof HttpStatusCodes];

function handleResponse(status: HttpStatus) {
  // Function body
}

// Usage
handleResponse(HttpStatusCodes.OK); // Works
handleResponse(123); // Error: Argument of type '123' is not assignable to parameter of type 'HttpStatus'.
```

#### Using a Namespace with Type Alias

Alternatively, for a more namespace-like organization without using an actual enum, you can use TypeScript's namespace feature combined with type aliases:

```javascript
namespace HttpStatus {
  export const OK = 200;
  export const BadRequest = 400;
  export const Unauthorized = 401;
}

type HttpStatus = typeof HttpStatus[keyof typeof HttpStatus];

function handleResponse(status: HttpStatus) {
  // Function body
}

// Usage
handleResponse(HttpStatus.OK); // Works
handleResponse(123); // Error: This type is not assignable to parameter of type 'HttpStatus'.
```
